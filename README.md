# Azure Disk Management Dashboard

This repository provides a local Azure disk management toolset for:

- viewing all managed disks in a selected subscription
- identifying Premium SSD `v1` disks that can be migrated to Premium SSD `v2`
- creating snapshots before migration
- migrating selected disks from `Premium_LRS` to `PremiumV2_LRS`
- identifying and deleting unattached disks

The main user experience is the local dashboard in `dashboard/app.py`.

## What is in this repo

### 1. Dashboard

`dashboard/app.py` is a local web dashboard that uses your Azure CLI login.

It supports:

- selecting any available Azure subscription
- optional resource group filtering
- side navigation for:
  - `All Disks`
  - `Eligible Disks`
  - `Unattached Disks`
- selecting eligible V1 disks for migration
- optional snapshot creation before migration
- selecting unattached disks for export, portal review, or deletion
- CSV export

### 2. PowerShell script

`scripts/Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1` is a script-based workflow for inventory, migration, and cleanup from the terminal.

Use it if you prefer CLI/PowerShell automation instead of the dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+
- Python 3.11+
- Azure CLI installed
- Azure account with permission to read, update, snapshot, start/stop VMs, and delete disks

## How to run the dashboard

From the repo root:

```powershell
az login --use-device-code
python .\dashboard\app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

## Dashboard workflow

### All Disks

Use this view to inspect the full managed disk inventory for a subscription or resource group.

### Eligible Disks

Use this view to:

- select eligible `Premium_LRS` disks
- optionally enable `Backup Before Migration`
- click `Backup Selected` to create snapshots only
- click `Migrate Selected` to convert selected disks to `PremiumV2_LRS`

### Unattached Disks

Use this view to:

- select unattached disks
- click `Export CSV` to export selected unattached disks
- click `Open Selected` to open selected disks in Azure Portal
- click `Delete Selected` to delete selected unattached disks

## Important behavior

- OS disks are not migrated to Premium SSD v2
- attached data disks are deallocated with their VM before migration and started again afterward
- `Delete Selected` performs real deletion in Azure
- `Migrate Selected` performs real migration in Azure
- snapshots are created only when you choose `Backup Selected` or `Backup Before Migration`

## How to run the PowerShell script

### Inventory

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Inventory -SubscriptionId <subscription-id>
```

### Inventory with JSON report

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Inventory -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -ReportPath .\reports\inventory.json
```

### Migration dry run

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Migrate -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -WhatIf
```

### Execute migration

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Migrate -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -Apply
```

### Execute migration with snapshots

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Migrate -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -Apply -CreateSnapshotBefore
```

### Cleanup dry run

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Cleanup -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -WhatIf
```

### Execute cleanup

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-DiskManagement.ps1 -Action Cleanup -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -Apply
```

## Notes

- `Premium_LRS` is treated as V1
- `PremiumV2_LRS` is treated as V2
- other SKUs are shown but not migrated by default
- Azure can still reject migration based on subscription, VM, encryption, region, or workload constraints not fully detectable in advance
